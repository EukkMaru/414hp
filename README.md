## Team Projects I (Cryptography)

This project aims to implement various cryptographic protocols as a team, consisting of four students per team, with one team having five members. 
Our focus will be on asymmetric cryptosystems, including RSA and the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange, as well as symmetric encryption methods.

## Team Introduction

### Team name : 414HP

Our team name is "414HP." This name is derived from the combined horsepower of three cars owned by team members, 
plus an additional 1 horsepower contributed by 5 team members.
